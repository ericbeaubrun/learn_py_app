# Project Overview
This project is a learning tool designed to introduce students to basic Python programming concepts through an interactive game. By solving coding puzzles, users explore key topics such as data types, variable declarations, loops, and conditionals. Developed as part of a university group project at CY Cergy Paris Université, the game provides users with a progressive level-based structure to enhance their programming skills.

# Key Features
- Chapter and Level Selection: Users can choose from chapters representing different programming topics, with levels of increasing difficulty.
- Integrated Code Editor: A built-in editor with syntax highlighting allows users to write and execute Python code directly in the game.
- Personalized Feedback: Hints and corrections are provided at each level to guide users through their coding journey.
- Code Execution and Animation: Users can run their Python code to move a character on a grid, visually representing the code’s effect.
- Error Handling: Detailed error messages for syntax issues, including line numbers, help users identify and fix mistakes.
- Progress Tracking: Completed chapters and levels are marked, allowing users to follow their learning progress.

# Tutorial
The character's movement is controlled by the user’s code. Specific instructions in the code are modified to trigger animation signals that move the character on the game grid, providing real-time visual feedback.
